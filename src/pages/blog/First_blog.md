### MY COMMITMENT:
So , the thing is i suck at DSA my entire 3 yrs in clg , never was good at CP either , was avg dev dude who could name insane stuff but could not impl them , for a random reason (mostly passion) i started loop up research stuff 
alot , and decided to go for research Mtech , so i wanted to go out aboard , but because this happening its not feasiable now anyway , decided to try my luck with gate , i looked up alot of research stuff in their high performance compute & database systems lab
and really wanted to impl stuff like that , but as a dumb 4th yr kid with exp in web dev (framework knowledge , other useless stuff ) who failed at all the stuff i did before (oss x2 etc) , it would not possible for me to do such heavy stuff , i found the perfect chance to turn around my life (feels like i am doomed for leaving placements aswell for it , might not be a great decision , but i believe in try in one thing and excel at it , after failing /giveups ) , prepare for gate like a insane hound , and build some side projects based on the research projects i want to contribute too ,
Not sure where this will take me but i want to progress as a dev , and hoping this 6 months of constant work will help , ie. did write this for me only too keep me on this track that i really want to pursue , has for realty checks do give me some of them . I will constantly blog my work here , along with gate stuff , documenting stuff always will keep me serious , i suppose 

### STUFF I AM DOING:
- Building stuff in raw cpp (checkout my /CSERVER project on github , etc)
- Prep for gate (Using good books , will put out learnings hopefully)
- Try solving some qs (To get better impl .... CP-3 book , striver) ...  this feels unrealistic :<


### CONCLUSION:
If anyone reads this jardon and feels i am a loser , please do remind me of it , will help me be practical , and i am a core believer of insane skill over DSA,CGPA,etc kind a guy , won't get hired obviously with attitude for a while , hopefuuly my skill perfection journey saves me .Finally this blog feels hypocritically honestly but hope it gives me that launch .
